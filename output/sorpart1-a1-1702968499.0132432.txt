Kajin was angry, so he expressed it by being mean to Daven. Daven couldn't do anything but try not to cry.
He found it difficult to accept that the adults who came before him ignored the situation.
Daven's uncle was highly regarded, but he disappeared from the family a while back and never returned.
Because there was no one to oversee or guide him, Kajin developed into a dominant figure.
"He easily defeated everyone because he had exceptional talent and the favor of the god of swords."
Following that, he would confront Daven, who felt envious of Kajin's abilities and prowess.
Kajin hated how Daven looked at him and decided to confront him fully because he couldn't stand being seen like that by someone who didn't appreciate art.
Kajin tells Daven that no matter how hard Daven works all his life, he won't be able to become strong like Kajin. Kajin believes that Daven's efforts won't lead to him gaining the same kind of strength.
Daven has a strong desire to win, and he truly wants it. However, he realizes that simply working hard is not enough to fulfill his dreams.
As Kajin grew older, he became less motivated to train and instead turned to alcohol, ferals, and drugs. He started neglecting his physical and mental well-being, indulging in destructive behaviors. Training took a backseat as he fell into a pattern of relying on substances to cope with life's challenges. This shift in priorities had a detrimental effect on his overall health and development. Kajin's once-promising future took a troubling turn as he succumbed to the allure of these vices.
Daven tried, but he couldn't defeat him.
Kajin was really smart but lazy, while Daven was not so smart but worked hard. Daven is sure that their situations will change someday.
Daven experienced numerous conflicts, but the most important one stood out.
After they traded punches, he finally gained the advantage over Kajin for the first time.
He blinded Kajin and then moved fast to hit him directly, which helped him win the fight.
Before that moment, they had fought each other 21 times and lost every single time to Kajin.
Despite facing numerous setbacks and constant discouragement from others, Daven managed to persevere for 29 years. People ridiculed him, belittling his abilities and urging him to quit. However, he defied their expectations, refusing to let their criticism define him.
He won despite everything, and as a result, everyone cheered for him.
Kajin did not want to be defeated by Daven. It was something he couldn't handle. The thought of losing to Daven was unbearable for him. Kajin had a strong desire to come out on top and not let Daven win. The fear of losing to Daven drove him to do whatever it took to avoid defeat.
Daven heard the words that hurt him from his parents when he was younger. Those words were full of contempt and made him feel bad.
Daven tells Kajin that if he were in his shoes, he wouldn't have chosen to live that way.
He regretted spending his life on alcohol and drugs.
He expresses his belief that he could have led a more fulfilling existence instead of taking advantage of those who are vulnerable.
As Daven prepares to leave, believing that everything is finished, Kajin suddenly thrusts his sword into Daven's chest, shocking everyone present. The unexpected attack leaves everyone speechless and in disbelief.
Kajin was seen as a fool until the very end.
Even though Daven managed to defeat Kajin, his chances of survival were slim.
