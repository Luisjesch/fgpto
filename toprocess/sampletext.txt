This is the story of a boy who, from the moment he was born, was despised by his parents
 His name is Daven, and his misfortune was to be born on the same day and at the same time as Kajin, a child blessed by the sword God "Keshack" â€” born with a blessed body and talent


Daven's mother only wished her son was Kajin instead of him
 She and his father were disappointed in Daven, one of the reasons being that he was missing his right arm
 His mother would whisper to him every night that he should die
 Daven was aware of this and apologized to her, not knowing why he was despised
 He did not want to die

##
When Daven was not yet born, he heard his father say that he was the hope
 At that time, they were looking forward to Daven, as his father could never beat his older brother
 But he hoped that when Daven was born, that child would be better than his brother's son
 Daven's father expected him to defeat Kajin, yet he was born with only one hand and without the blessing of a God
 The mere fact that he was born crushed all his father's hopes
