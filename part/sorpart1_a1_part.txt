Once upon a time, there was a boy. Right from the day he was born, his parents didn't like him. They felt strong dislike towards him.
Daven is a boy who had the unfortunate luck of being born on the same day and at the same time as Kajin. Kajin is a child who is considered blessed by the sword God "Keshack." Kajin was born with a special body and talent that are considered to be gifts from the sword God.
Daven's mother had a simple wish - she wanted her son to be like Kajin, instead of being himself.
Daven's father and she were not happy with him. One of the reasons for their disappointment was that he didn't have his right arm.
Every night, his mother would quietly tell him that she wished he wasn't alive. She would say these hurtful words in a hushed voice, making him feel really sad and confused. He couldn't understand why his own mother would want him to die, and it made him feel very alone and scared.
Daven knew he had done something wrong and said sorry to her, even though he didn't understand why she disliked him.
The person had a strong desire to continue living and did not wish to experience death.
Before Daven was born, he overheard his father describing him as the source of hope.
During that period, they eagerly anticipated Daven's arrival because his father was always unable to surpass his older brother in various aspects of life.
He had a hope that when Daven was born, the child would surpass his brother's son in some way.
Daven's father had high hopes for him to overcome Kajin, but Daven was born with a disadvantage - he had only one hand and lacked the favor of a deity.
His birth shattered his father's dreams. The simple fact of his existence dashed all of his father's hopes. When he was born, his father's aspirations were completely ruined.
Kajin played happily and started walking, but Daven still had difficulty getting up.
Daven started walking, while Kajin was already skilled with a sword.
When Daven first held a blade, Kajin had already learned about mana and started practicing Samian's sword fighting techniques.
Kajin became the person that Daven admired and felt jealous of. This happened at some time in the past.
At seven years old, he was chosen to work as one of Kajin's helpers.
Everyone knew he was there to assist Kajin, but the truth was that his parents sold him for a large sum of money.
As they got older, Kajin used Daven to his advantage because, right from the start, Daven was a bother to him.
Kajin was angry, so he expressed it by being mean to Daven. Daven couldn't do anything but try not to cry.
He found it difficult to accept that the adults who came before him ignored the situation.
Daven's uncle was highly regarded, but he disappeared from the family a while back and never returned.
Because there was no one to oversee or guide him, Kajin developed into a dominant figure.
"He easily defeated everyone because he had exceptional talent and the favor of the god of swords."
Following that, he would confront Daven, who felt envious of Kajin's abilities and prowess.
Kajin hated how Daven looked at him and decided to confront him fully because he couldn't stand being seen like that by someone who didn't appreciate art.
Kajin tells Daven that no matter how hard Daven works all his life, he won't be able to become strong like Kajin. Kajin believes that Daven's efforts won't lead to him gaining the same kind of strength.
Daven has a strong desire to win, and he truly wants it. However, he realizes that simply working hard is not enough to fulfill his dreams.
As Kajin grew older, he became less motivated to train and instead turned to alcohol, ferals, and drugs. He started neglecting his physical and mental well-being, indulging in destructive behaviors. Training took a backseat as he fell into a pattern of relying on substances to cope with life's challenges. This shift in priorities had a detrimental effect on his overall health and development. Kajin's once-promising future took a troubling turn as he succumbed to the allure of these vices.
Daven tried, but he couldn't defeat him.
Kajin was really smart but lazy, while Daven was not so smart but worked hard. Daven is sure that their situations will change someday.
Daven experienced numerous conflicts, but the most important one stood out.
After they traded punches, he finally gained the advantage over Kajin for the first time.
He blinded Kajin and then moved fast to hit him directly, which helped him win the fight.
Before that moment, they had fought each other 21 times and lost every single time to Kajin.
Despite facing numerous setbacks and constant discouragement from others, Daven managed to persevere for 29 years. People ridiculed him, belittling his abilities and urging him to quit. However, he defied their expectations, refusing to let their criticism define him.
He won despite everything, and as a result, everyone cheered for him.
Kajin did not want to be defeated by Daven. It was something he couldn't handle. The thought of losing to Daven was unbearable for him. Kajin had a strong desire to come out on top and not let Daven win. The fear of losing to Daven drove him to do whatever it took to avoid defeat.
Daven heard the words that hurt him from his parents when he was younger. Those words were full of contempt and made him feel bad.
Daven tells Kajin that if he were in his shoes, he wouldn't have chosen to live that way.
He regretted spending his life on alcohol and drugs.
He expresses his belief that he could have led a more fulfilling existence instead of taking advantage of those who are vulnerable.
As Daven prepares to leave, believing that everything is finished, Kajin suddenly thrusts his sword into Daven's chest, shocking everyone present. The unexpected attack leaves everyone speechless and in disbelief.
Kajin was seen as a fool until the very end.
Even though Daven managed to defeat Kajin, his chances of survival were slim.
The Sun Blade Greatsword is exclusively used by the Samian family. It holds the Mana of the Samian family and has anti-magic abilities. This means that it can resist magic unless Saint Layla intervenes miraculously.
Daven had no chance of making it through. It seemed impossible for Daven to survive. There was no hope for Daven to live.
Daven, just before he falls asleep, says to Kajin that he will forever be known as someone who never succeeds.
Daven wakes up and finds himself tied up, thinking he's in hell. It's a surprising and confusing situation for him. He's struggling to understand what's happening and feeling scared. The experience is unsettling and disorienting for Daven.
A masked person tells him that he is lucky because the amazing Saint Layla was at the arena and healed Daven. Daven's entire body was broken, and he could only breathe.
After that, the man asked Daven if he had made an agreement with the devil.
Daven is shocked by what he hears. The guy says his parents confessed, so there's no point in denying it.
In addition, bottles containing Daven's blood, which were intended for a contract with the devil, were discovered at his family's residence.
He is being accused of a terrible act - sacrificing 300 innocent children to gain strength. These accusations label him as a demon.
Daven was able to overcome Kajin, but he couldn't conquer the Samian family.
His family decided to prioritize Kajin instead of him.
Due to the accusations against him, Daven has been given a life sentence in prison, and his ability to use Mana has been restricted.
Daven's muscles were severed, and his magical energy was locked away by numerous restraints.Transcript for sorpart1:
